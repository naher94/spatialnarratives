/// The Factory Pattern + more destructruing fun
///
/// A Factory allows for the precise creation of many objects,
/// to whatever similar specifications they all have.
/// In this case, we're just sending along the simple stuff:
/// everything has a place, everything has a material,
/// they should all have shadows enabled, and so on.
///
/// Something more interesting is evident in the functions below.
/// What do they seem to do?
///
/// They take in the arguments to a constructor and then call it.
/// Who would do a thing like that? Why?
///
/// We would. That's who.
///
/// What this allows us to do is customize inputs.
/// When we create the ground, we just tack on a fourth parameter.
/// Since we passed the input function its arguments,
/// the rest of the function couldn't care less what it does.
/// We'll be using this approach later on, in the renderer.
